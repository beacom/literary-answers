## The Foundational Computer Science Text
I have fond memories of this book from before even reading it. As a teenager friends and I who were computer programming enthusiasts discovered a copy of it at Barnes & Noble in Rochester, Minnesota. I quipped, "if we read this we'd never have to think again", implying that we'd already know all the useful algorithms for all problem domains. There was an nugget of truth in that youthful joke.
A few years later, I owned the work as the textbook in my first computer science course taught by the late [Professor John Riedl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Riedl). He gave the following glowing recommendation of the book.
> If you were trapped on a deserted island with this book for a year and read it from cover to cover you should be granted a bechelor's degree in computer science. If you actually understood it all you should be granted a PhD.
Professor Riedl's enthusiasm for all things computer science was rather contagious and I'd always wanted to dive into the booker in greater depth than coursework required. This is an effort to finally do so.
